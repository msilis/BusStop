# Bus Stops Announcement System

This is a fun and interactive project for my kids to play with. It simulates a bus announcement system, where they can click on different bus stop buttons and hear the corresponding bus stop announcement.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. You will see a list of bus stop buttons.
3. Click on any button to hear the bus stop announcement.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that contains the structure of the web page.
- `style.css`: This file contains all the styles used in the project.
- `script.js`: This is where the main JavaScript code resides. It contains the functionality for playing the bus stop announcements.

## Note

This will work on desktops and Android phones, but not on iPads and iPhones. Not yet anyway.

Make sure your device's sound is turned on to hear the announcements. Enjoy the ride!
